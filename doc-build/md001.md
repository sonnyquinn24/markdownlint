This rule is triggered when you skip heading levels in a Markdown document, for
example:

```markdown
# Heading 1

### Heading 3

We skipped out a 2nd level heading in this document
```

When using multiple heading levels, nested headings should increase by only one
level at a time:

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

## Another Heading 2

### Another Heading 3
```

If [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) front matter is present and
contains a `title` property (commonly used with blog posts), this rule treats
that as a top level heading and will report a violation if the actual first
heading is not a level 2 heading. To use a different property name in the
front matter, specify the text of a regular expression via the
`front_matter_title` parameter. To disable the use of front matter by this
rule, specify `""` for `front_matter_title`. When front matter is not present,
the first heading can be any level.

Rationale: Headings represent the structure of a document and can be confusing
when skipped - especially for accessibility scenarios. More information:
